# ENEE2304 Circuit Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves detailed circuit analysis using PSPICE 9.1 student version. Students are required to work individually to construct and simulate circuits, focusing on understanding and analyzing voltages and currents within the circuits.

## Project Description
### Objectives
- Construct PSPICE schematics for given circuits.
- Simulate the schematics to analyze node voltages and branch currents.
- Determine constants in a given circuit through simulation and use these to predict circuit behavior under specified conditions.

### Instructions
- Each student must work individually.
- Utilize PSPICE 9.1 to solve the problems assigned.
- Include clear snapshots of the circuit's schematic from PSPICE in your report.

### Components Naming Convention
- Label components in the circuit with your name for easy identification in simulations, as demonstrated in the provided figures.

### Circuit Analysis Tasks
1. **Circuit One Simulation**:
   - Create and simulate the first circuit.
   - Analyze and report voltages at each node and currents in each branch.
2. **Circuit Two Simulation**:
   - Analyze the response of the circuit to different inputs.
   - Use simulations to find constants `k1` and `k2`.
   - Predict outputs for specified input values and verify using PSPICE.
   - Calculate the average power delivered by a given voltage source.

### University ID Based Values
- Use the last three digits of university ID to determine the values of resistors `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.
- Replace any zero values with five.
